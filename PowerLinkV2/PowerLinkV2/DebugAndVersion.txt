It is observed that data not getting updated on web.

For Mfm Version 
My Project->Application->Assembly Information->Assembly and File Version->1.1.0.0

For PowerLinkV2 Version 2.1.0.3

Hence debug started

Decided to insert a dropdown for uploading time and we will bind its property to some application setting
like other drop down and will keep its value selectable as 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min.
Then shifted Web Update routine to polling timer and decided to use single timer because using two timere is 
dificult.

Also logic for whether time now is divisible by upload time is added to upload data of
hh:05 hrs or hh:15 hrs or hh:30 hrs. And not interminant random data.

Checked and found correct.

Version changed to 2.1.0.4
